# IoT-Based System for Environmental Monitoring and Crop Prediction

## Overview
This project integrates IoT and Machine Learning concepts for smart agriculture. 
It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to collect environmental data from various sensors. 
This data is then processed to provide crop recommendations and yield predictions, enabling data-driven farming decisions.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- Data transmission over Wi-Fi for remote access.
- System architecture designed for integration with a Machine Learning model for predictive analysis.
- Low-power design suitable for field deployment.
